    <h2>Smoked Garlic Paste</h2>

    <p>Smoked slowly over oak, this smooth garlic paste adds a seductively, sweet, smoky depth to any
    dish.</p>

    <p>White garlic bulbs are hot-smoked over oak to create a distinctively intense, smoky garlic aroma and
    flavour that takes food to the next level. Our unique blend includes our Bart Smoked Garlic granules
    to intensify the flavour.</p>

    <h3>Inspiration:</h3>

    <ul class="u-list">
        <li>Try mixing a teaspoonful with some mayonnaise for a deliciously, moreish dip.</li>
        <li>Stir into your bechamel before adding the cheese to a cauliflower cheese bake.</li> 
        <li>Stir into melted butter, for frying mushrooms and serve on sliced, sourdough bread with
            black pepper and parsley.</li>
    </ul>
