                    <h2>Black Garlic Paste</h2>

                    <p>Sweet, earthy and balsamic in flavour, black garlic is a decadent ingredient to elevate your cookery.
                    White garlic bulbs are gently heated and fermented in a humid environment which turns the cloves
                    sweet, dark and soft. We have used 78% premium quality black garlic cloves and blended with
                    sunflower oil and lemon juice to make a paste that is easy to use.</p>
                    
                    <p>In fact, there are approx. 3 black garlic bulbs in every jar.</p>
